# VolunteerAct
VolunteerAct is a Django-based application that helps people find and participate in volunteer opportunities. Users can browse events across different categories, sign up for activities, and create their own events. The platform also allows for community interaction through likes and comments, making it easy to connect and engage with others committed to making a positive impact.
